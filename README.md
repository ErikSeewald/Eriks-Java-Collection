# Eriks-Java-Collection
This is a collection of my favorite hobby java projects. The main intention here is to experiment with different computer science concepts.

## Prerequisites
To execute the jar you will need jdk 17 or higher.
If you want to have music playing in games like 'TaxCollector' you will also need the 'Music' folder to be in the same directory as the jar.
