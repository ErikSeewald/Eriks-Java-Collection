# Eriks-Java-Collection
This is a collection of my favorite hobby java projects. The main intention here is to experiment with different computer science concepts.
The main menu provides a small explanation of each project on mouse hover.

## Notes
- A lot of these projects are quite old as they were my very first programming projects. They are the result of odd choices and a lack of experience.
- Some of the newer ones are still quite nice, but may experience issues on Windows 11. I only tested them on Windows 10 and Linux (X11 Graphics).

## Prerequisites
To execute the jar you will need jdk 17 or higher.
