# Eriks-Java-Collection
This is a collection of my favorite hobby java projects. The main intention here is to experiment with different computer science concepts.
The main menu provides a small explanation of each project on mouse hover.

## Notes
- A lot of these projects are quite old as they were my very first programming projects. They are the result of odd choices and a lack of experience.
- I am still proud of a few of the newer projects, but sadly they were all developed when I was working exclusively on Windows 10. As much as Java prides
  itself on being great for cross platform developement, it seems that this starts to break down when it comes to graphical projects. On linux, mac or windows 11, if something feels
  clunky in a way that seems unintentional (especially regarding frame timing), that is probably why.

## Prerequisites
To execute the jar you will need jdk 17 or higher.
If you want to have music playing in games like 'TaxCollector' you will also need the 'Music' folder to be in the same directory as the jar.
